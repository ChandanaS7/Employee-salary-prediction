Employee-salary-prediction
This project aims to predict employee salaries based on multiple features like experience, education, job role, and location using different machine learning regression models. The solution is built using Python and scikit-learn.

Project Overview

- Goal: Build a predictive model to estimate salaries using employee data.
- Techniques Used: Data Cleaning, Label Encoding, Feature Scaling, Regression Modeling, Evaluation Metrics, and Visualization.
- Models Implemented:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
